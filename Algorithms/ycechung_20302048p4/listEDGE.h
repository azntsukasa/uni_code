/* header file for the list of edges for the digraph implementation */

/* Type Definitions
 * --------------- */

/* 
Another way of finding size of list is returning the entire list each time an operation occurs on it
so if the kth nodeEdge has an operation, the linked list from kth to nth will be returned where n is the last one
- the trade off is that you have to manually determine its size
- where as my implmentation have a predetermined size (for algorithm efficiency) using a bit more memory
